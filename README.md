# face-recognition-and-tracking-python

  To track face and pan tilt mechanism will track it. Using OpenCV it will identify the face and using pan tilt mechanism will track it the face.

Technologies used: 
  • Python, OpenCV, Arduino ide.

Hardware:
  • Arduino
  • Pan-tilt mechanism
  • 2x servo motors

Roles & Responsibilities:

  • With the help of OpenCV, the live face recognition will be recorded, and the image will be desired format.
  • The data will send to Arduino ide with the coordinates which handle hardware, pan tilt. Which will recognize and track face.
